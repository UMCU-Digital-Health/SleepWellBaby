wake state prediction algorithm in preterm infants. SLEEP, 2022, https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsac143
- **Point of Contact:** [Richard Bartels](r.t.bartels-6@umcutrecht.nl)

Based on the dataset card template from huggingface, which can be found [here](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/blob/main/templates/README_guide.md#table-of-contents).

### Dataset Summary
The dataset contains behavarious sleep-wake state classifications according to the [BeSSPI scheme](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2022.01.020) together with vital parameter data for 46 preterm infants in the age range $[28, 34)$ postmenstrual weeks.


### Supported Tasks and Leaderboards
- `Classification`: The dataset can be used to train a model for classifying sleep states of preterm infants at the neonatal intensive care unit. Success on this task is typically measured by achieving a high (macro-averaged) AUC score. The performance of the best model is currently around $0.7$.


### Languages

The dataset is in English.

## Dataset Structure

### Data Instances

#### Sleep stage annotations
This dataset contains sleep stage annotations recorded in an Excel file using a long format. Each row represents a time point during the observation period. The columns include:
- Time: Minutes elapsed since the start of the observations.
- Sleep state: The observed sleep stage, which can be one of the following categories:
  - AS: Active Sleep
  - IS: Indeterminate Sleep
  - QS: Quiet Sleep
  - W: Wake
- Observed behaviour: baby behaviour used for classification
- Comments: optional field with potential disturbances such as sounds, interventions etc.
- Confidence score: -1, 0 or 1 to indicate confidence in the observation.

Additionally, each file contains  patient characteristics
- NICU ward
- Bed location
- Type of crib
- respiratory support
- Postmenstrual age
- Gender

#### Vital parameter data
Vital parameter data was extracted using *BedBase* and exported using *SignalBase* (University Medical Center Utrecht). The data came in `.tsv` format and was structured in long format with a timestamp and a parameter value. A separate file was extracted for each vital parameter, including heart rate, pulse rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, arterial blood pressure (mean, diastolic and systolic), perfusion index.  The data frequency is $0.4$ or $1$ Hz depending on the BedBase version.

#### Input data for inference

Input data for inference is structured as follows:

### Data Fields
The most important datafield are provided below

#### Sleep stage observations
- `NICU room`: int, neonatal ward identifier `1`
- `Location bed`: int, bed location identifier `7`
- `Type of crib`: string describing crib`closed incubator`
- `Respiratory support`: string describing type of respiratory support `nCPAP`
- `Gender`: string `M` or `F`
- `PMA at observation`: string with PMA in weeks plus days `30+3`
- `Date`: date of observation `01-01-2001`
- `Starting time`: timestamp, starting time of observation `8:05`
- `Ending time`: timestamp, ending time of observation `11:05`
- `Time`: timedelta, time since starting time (hh:mm:ss) `1:30:00`

### Data Splits
The dataset consists of training ($N = 37$) and a validation set ($N = 9$).

For model training a grouped nested cross-validation procedure was used, where grouping took place on patient id.

## Dataset Creation

### Curation Rationale

The dataset was created for the purpose of training and evaluation (machine-learning) models for monitoring sleep stages in preterm infants.

### Source Data

Data comes from bedside monitors (vital parameter data) and electronic health records (patient characteristics).

#### Initial Data Collection and Normalization

Bedside monitor data was collected using BedBase. EHR data comes from Metavision.

#### Who are the source data producers?

Vital parameter data is machine generated (bedside monitor).
Data from the EHR (patient characteristics) is filled in by humans, notably healthcare professionals.

### Annotations

keywords = {Preterm infants, Sleep-wake stages, Behavioral observation, Neonatal intensive care},
}
```

#### Annotation process
Sleep stages were annotated via the current golden standard, observational sleep stage classification. Sleep stages of subjects were typically recorded over one to three hours periods in which a sleep stage was annotated every minute based on the past minute of observations. This observational classification can be performed either directly or through video recordings.

The typical interrater agreement between two human annotators is $\kappa = 0.8$.

#### Who are the annotators?

Sleep stages were annotated by humans trained in the BeSSPI protocol.

Typical annotators are research interns or PhD students. For new researchers an interrater agreement was determined (Cohen's $\kappa$).

### Personal and Sensitive Information
This data contains personal information from the electronic-health record, including patient characteristics such as birth date, gestational age, gender, birth weight, delivery method, plurality and APGAR scores. In addition, it contains vital parameter data from the bedside monitor. Researchers only have access to pseudonomyzed data, where all subjects received a pseudo ID.

## Considerations for Using the Data

### Social Impact of Dataset
This dataset can help by providing more insight into the sleep-wake pattern of preterm infants. Moreover, it can support in the development of a automated sleep-wake classifiers that could potentially enable the use of sleep as a vital sign.

### Discussion of Biases

Sleep observations with a confidence score of $-1$ were excluded for model development.

The patient population consists only of patients from NICU of the Wilhelmina's Children Hospital (WKZ). Since this is a single (academic) hospital in the Netherlands, this patient population will not be representative of all hospitals. In addition, practices in this particular NICU that can affect sleep-wake cycles might be different at other hospitals. Finally, all data was collected during the daytime and results derived from it could be less accurate during nighttime.
