## Introduction
This repository contains code to run the sleep-well baby model that can classify sleep stages in 
preterm infants based on vital signs. It only contains code for model inference, not for training.

## Getting started
### Installation

The easiest way to install the `sleepwellbaby` package is to 
to use the package manager [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), a modern Python package manager that simplifies dependency management and ensures reproducibility:

```bash
uv sync
```

### Starterkit
An example of how to run this code can be found in [notebooks/example.ipynb](notebooks/example.ipynb)

## Documentation
Dataset and model information can be found in the [dataset card](docs/dataset_card.md) and [model card](docs/model_card.md), respectively.

## Citation instructions
Reference should be made to the sleep-well baby paper when using this software.
